#This is an example of a catering event
#If the catering event you are trying to make has a picture instead of a video, copy the picture link from facebook by right clicking on it, and paste it after the imageLink= property
#Leave the videoLink blank in this case
#Otherwise, if you want to have a video at the top of the event, right click the facebook video, click "show video url", copy the numbers after /videos/ (looks like this https://www.facebook.com/Inforce01/videos/481648762324179/), and paste that where the numbers are in the example above (after video_id=)
#Set all other fields as shown above (date, title, description)
